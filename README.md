# Advent of Code 2023

Rust solves for Advent of Code 2023.

Each day has it's own source file with builtin tests and its own input file.

Goal is speed, but without hacky optimizations of things.

Hopefully this will help somebody.

## Output
```
Day 1 Solve Time: 985us
Day 1 Part 1: 54605
Day 1 Part 2: 55429

Total Solve Time: 985us
```
